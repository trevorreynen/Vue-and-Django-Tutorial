# tutorial_vue

## Project setup
Open the Command Prompt and change directory to **/Vue-and-Django-Tutorial/tutorial_vue/**. Then run the following command. That command *should* install all necessary modules.
```
npm install
```
Once the command has finished, look in the node_modules folder created and make sure you have folders called "axios", "bulma", and "bulma-toast". If not, type each of these commands hitting enter after each in the command prompt.
```
npm install axios
npm install bulma
npm install bulma-toast
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
Every time you want to work with this project, you must run the server to see the site. It should automatically refresh when something is changed.
```
npm run serve
```
If you experience any problems like I do when working on my laptop, just CTRL+C and ^ up arrow to run the command again.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
