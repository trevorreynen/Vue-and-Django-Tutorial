	The problem I previously ran into was because all mutations in the store's index.js was in the getters section.

	-Implement a loading bar
	-Create a Django app for the leads
	-Database model for leads
	-Serializer for the leads
	-View for the leads
	-Set up the urls
	-Create page for showing the leads
	-Make it possible to add leads

	python manage.py startapp lead

Took a break but back at 7:50-ish AM

	python manage.py makemigrations
	python manage.py migrate

	Quick Note:

	Today I begin working on Part 4
	TODO List from Part 4 video:
	- Add leads link in the menu
	- Hide sign up / log in buttons when authenticated
	- Make it possible to view a lead
	- Make it possible to edit a lead
	- Show toast when saving leads
	- Show toast when adding leads

	Done with Part 4 at ~4:35 PM. Ran into a problem that differs from the Part 4 video.
		My problem was that I after I clicked the details button for a lead in the leads table, the page wouldn't show up. The console noted something similar to "missing required param 'id'". After looking at the comments, one comment specifically by Essam AbdElHam mentioned having the same problem.
		The solution that worked for me was in a reply to the comment I just mentioned, saying "I tried to replace { id: lead.id } with  { lead: lead.id } and everything worked fine for me." I also did that, changing { id: lead.id } to { lead: lead.id } in Lead.vue and Leads.vue. That fixed the problem. I mention this here because as the person who noted the fix said, I also don't quite understand how this fixed the problem and if it's correct or not. So for future reference these two paragraphs are here just in case.
