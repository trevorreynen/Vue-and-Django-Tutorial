Taking a break. Will continue later. Stopped at 2.55 of Part 2 video.



Tue. 05/03/22, ~10:40 PM | PC
    After pressing CTRL+Tilde while highlighting './tutorial_env/Scripts/activate' from above in line 58, VS opens terminal and types: '& c:/GitHub/Vue-and-Django-Tutorial/tutorial_env/Scripts/Activate.ps1' automatically

    cd tutorial_django
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

    python manage.py createsuperuser

        'Password: ' adminTutorialPass
        'Password (again): ' adminTutorialPass

    python manage.py runserver

Stopped at 12:37 AM. Ran into an error that I cannot figure out yet. Paused video at 23:40 of Part 2. Will continue after a break.



Wed. 05/04/22, ~4:00 AM | PC
    The problem I previously ran into was because all mutations in the store's index.js was in the getters section.

    Part 2 video has now been completed.
    Part 3 video starts now (4:30 AM-ish).

    TODO List from Part 3 video:
    -Implement a loading bar
    -Create a Django app for the leads
    -Database model for leads
    -Serializer for the leads
    -View for the leads
    -Set up the urls
    -Create page for showing the leads
    -Make it possible to add leads

    python manage.py startapp lead

Took a break but back at 7:50-ish AM

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

    Quick Note:
        The account I created for testing is code@code.com and 1235password



Sat. 05/07/22, ~3:10 PM | PC
    Today I begin working on Part 4
    TODO List from Part 4 video:
    - Add leads link in the menu
    - Hide sign up / log in buttons when authenticated
    - Make it possible to view a lead
    - Make it possible to edit a lead
    - Show toast when saving leads
    - Show toast when adding leads

Done with Part 4 at ~4:35 PM. Ran into a problem that differs from the Part 4 video.
        My problem was that after I clicked the details button for a lead in the leads table, the page wouldn't show up. The console noted something similar to "missing required param 'id'". After looking at the comments, one comment specifically by Essam AbdElHam mentioned having the same problem.
        The solution that worked for me was in a reply to the comment I just mentioned, saying "I tried to replace { id: lead.id } with  { lead: lead.id } and everything worked fine for me." I also did that, changing { id: lead.id } to { lead: lead.id } in Lead.vue and Leads.vue. That fixed the problem. I mention this here because as the person who noted the fix said, I also don't quite understand how this fixed the problem and if it's correct or not. So for future reference these two paragraphs are here just in case.


Starting Part 5 at ~5:15 PM
    TODO List from Part 5 video:
    - Create Django app and model
- Create Serializer and View
- Store your user info in Vuex
- Add team-id and name to Vuex
- If you don't have team, send to create team page
- Create page for adding teams
- Fix login to implement teams (Vuex)

    With the virtualenv active and in the tutorial_django directory,
    python manage.py startapp team
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

    Quick Note: At some point I stopped adding the repeating commands for terminal like starting server for django and npm. So, even though I haven't added those to the log, I still often do that when working on the project.


    Taking a break around 6:00 PM. Stopped at 23:30 of Part 5 video. Ran into a problem that may or may not be a problem, I may just need to finish up the part 5 video and it wont be an error. ATM the "error" says,
        POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/teams/ 404 (Not Found)
        AddTeam.vue?c14a:64 Error: Request failed with status code 404

        - Make it possible to add members


    python manage.py makemigrations
        It is impossible to add a non-nullable field 'team' to lead without specifying a default. This is because the database needs something to populate existing rows.
        Please select a fix:
        1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column)
        2) Quit and manually define a default value in models.py.
        Select an option:
        "1"
        Please enter the default value as valid Python.
        The datetime and django.utils.timezone modules are available, so it is possible to provide e.g. timezone.now as a value.
        Type 'exit' to exit this prompt
        >>> "1"
        Migrations for 'lead':
            lead\migrations\0002_lead_team.py

    GitIgnore Info (Documentation/Notes)
        doc/frotz/  ==  doc/frotz
        doc/frotz   !=  a/doc/frotz
        frotz/  ==  frotz  &&  a/frotz

        Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:
            A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.

            A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.

    Forgot to add to log, finished part 8 around 3:30 PM.
